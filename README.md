# Crop_Production_Prediction
Crop Production Prediction using Machine Learning
  This project aims to predict crop production based on agricultural data using machine learning models. It follows a structured pipeline for data preparation, analysis, and model building, culminating in an interactive Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

Project Workflow
  Data Preparation-
    Cleaned and transformed raw agricultural data.
    Engineered new features and encoded categorical variables.
    
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-
    Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and patterns.
    Identified trends and outliers using visualizations.
    
  Model Building-
    Trained and optimized models, including Random Forest.
    Tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV for better accuracy.
    
  Evaluation & Insights-
    Assessed model performance using R² score and RMSE.
    Interpreted results to derive actionable insights for better yield predictions.
    
  Interactive Prediction App (Built with Streamlit)-
    Users can input agricultural parameters to predict crop production.
    Provides real-time insights based on trained models.
    
Tech Stack
  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
  Machine Learning (Random Forest)
  Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  Web App (Streamlit)
  
Results & Insights
  Achieved high R² scores for accurate predictions.
  Developed an easy-to-use interface for real-time crop production forecasting.
